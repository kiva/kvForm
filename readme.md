# webforms

This repo temporarily houses the webforms project.  Eventually, it will lead to at least the following modules:

* UI - (datepicker, color picker, range selector)
* Layout (inline / stacked / etc..)
* Messaging (error messages, tip messages, form level messaging)
* Shims (autofocus, required fields, placeholder text)
* Validation (tel, url, maxlength, pattern match, etc..)
